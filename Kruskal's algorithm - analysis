How does Kruskal's work?
1) First, all weights of edges are arranged in ascending order.
2) We choose the smallest edge and then try to add it to our spanning tree and if it forms a cycle, we discard it.
3) Repeat this until (v-1) edges are added to the minimum spanning tree.

Why does it fail for directed graph?
1) Using union-find method to detect cycles in a graph, the method fails for a directed graph.
 
 a -> b
 |    |   
 > c  >
 
 this is not a cycle but according to union-find method, this will be considered a cycle.
 
 a - parent - nothing
 b - parent - nothing 
 so b - parent - a
 c - parent - nothing
 so c - parent - b
 hence, abc will be considered a cycle.
 but this is not true.
 
 2) Negative weights will not be a problem as only the differences between edge weights matter for the MST.
