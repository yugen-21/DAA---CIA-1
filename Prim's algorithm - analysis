 How does it work?
 Assuming that all nodes are connected, we try to find a minimum spanning tree. For this, all nodes MUST have adjacent nodes i.e, 
 they must all be accessible from any given node.
 1) So first we maintain an array - visited[n] (n - no. of nodes).
 [a,b,c,d,e]
 [T,F,F,F,F]
 2) If a is the first node, then another array weights:
 [a,b,c,d,e]
 [0,inf,inf,inf,inf,inf] (inf - infinity)
 3) select an unvisited node : say, b
 visited[1] = T;
 4)if(weights[1] > weight between b and any adjacent element
 {
 weights[1] = weight between b and that adjacent element.
 
 This way, you can create a minimum spanning tree. 
 So, why does it fail in a directed graph?
1) In our given example, no node is reachable from node D. As Prim's assumes every node is reachable, it fails.
2) As for negative weights (E-D is -5), that is not a problem because it is only the differences between edge weights that matter for the MST. 
If that seems to be a problem, a huge positive constant could be added to the weights and the MST algorithm will still work.
